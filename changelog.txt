Since we're working in sprints of 2 weeks we're also trying to follow a similar
release cycle. This will of course mean fewer major changes, but also steadier
stream of new features. How agile!

To keep y'all informed we'll at least send the changelog on a mailing list:
link_to('mailinglist'), but of course if there is anything particularly noteworthy,
you can always expect to find it mentioned.

So, on to the changes to for this release, 0.0.2

We've commited some I18n related changes. In order to keep the locale keys both
'dry' and flexible we now support cascading fallbacks in views and have added a
missing translation log that keeps you informed on all missing translations (cool).

It is now possible to reuse and extend existing menus from other engines.

We've also improved the layout. For example the sidebar is now in the the default
layout and the table tree drag and drop is improved in the section and categories trees
and it also now has a spinner.

We've also worked on the menus by adding missing I18n keys and changing the link order.
We've also improved category menus to now work with polymorphic 'categorizable' models.

We've also met Konstantin Haase, who did an RSoC project about improving
ActiveSupport::Dependencies. He gave us a few hints about how to fix our 'vertical
code slices' approach and thus fix the development mode too (which is currently broken).
